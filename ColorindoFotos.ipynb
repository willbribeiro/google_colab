Isso determina a resolução na qual a parte colorida da imagem é renderizada. A resolução mais baixa renderizará mais rapidamente e as cores também tendem a parecer mais vibrantes. Imagens mais antigas e de qualidade inferior, em particular, geralmente se beneficiam com a redução do fator de renderização. Fatores de renderização mais altos geralmente são melhores para imagens de qualidade mais alta, mas as cores podem ficar um pouco desbotadas.\n","\n","### watermarked\n","Selecionado por padrão, coloca um ícone de marca d'água de uma paleta no canto inferior esquerdo da imagem.
